# Awesome ID

Awesome ID is a sample app for android and IOS made in the Flutter framework. 

## Getting Started

Flutter needs to be installed to run the application.

The app shows an user profile, with a photo and some info (one of which states "CURRENT LEVEL"). We have a floating button that increases the level
